Aim :
1. Understand annotations
2. Create custom annotation and apply it
3. Understand a very basic annotation in Spring boot and how it is processed


-----

Annotations offer an alternative to xml descriptors and markers like we used to do:
<bean id = "" ..., it's replaced with @Bean.


Note : We process annotations using Java reflection.
