There are 7 bitwise operators in java :
1. And (&) : If both bits are 1 then the result is 1.

2. Or (|) : If either of the bits are 1 then the result is 1.

3. Xor (^) : If both bits are different then result is 1.

Note :
Negative numbers are represented as 2's complement in computer.
MSB is 1 for negative number.

For 32 bit memory,
If all bits are set then value is 2^32 - 1.

For unsigned integer , value of ~x = 2^32 - 1 - x.

Binary representation of -x = 2's complement of x = 2^n - 1 - x.
where n is the number of bits supported by hardware (i.e. data lines to microprocessor).

Steps :
1. Invert all bits of x.
2. Add 1 to it.

4. Bitwise NOT (~) : ~x = 2's complement of x.

5. Left Shift ( << ) :
