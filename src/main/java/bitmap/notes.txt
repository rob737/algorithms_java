There are 7 bitwise operators in java :
1. And (&) : If both bits are 1 then the result is 1.

2. Or (|) : If either of the bits are 1 then the result is 1.

3. Xor (^) : If both bits are different then result is 1.

Note :
Negative numbers are represented as 2's complement in computer.
MSB is 1 for negative number.

For 32 bit memory,
If all bits are set then value is 2^32 - 1.

For unsigned integer , value of ~x = 2^32 - x.
