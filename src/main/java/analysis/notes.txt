--- Order of growth :

c < loglogN < log N < n^1/3 < n^1/2 < n < n^2 < n^3 < n^4 < 2^n < n^n

You can put values and verify it.

Also, logx (assuming base as 10) means to what value of power of 10 (base) must the result
will become x.
i.e. 10^k = x. (i.e. value of k is basically logx)
e.g. log10 to the base 10 is 1.

Best case, worst case and average case.

--- Asymptotic notations :

Big O : Exact or upper bound.
e.g. O(n) means time taken to execute the task can maximum be some constant times n.
Can be used to represent worst case analysis.

Theta : Exact.
e.g. Theta(n) means time taken would exactly be equal to some constant times n irrespective of the input.

Omega : Exact or Lower.
e.g. Omega(n) means time taken would "atleast" be some constant times n.
